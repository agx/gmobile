  * data: Add border radius for oneplus,enchilada

  [ Evangelos Ribeiro Tzaras ]
  * data/hwdb: Insert empty line to indicate a new input device.
    Otherwise it will get ignored (slightly edited for readability):

gmobile (0.3.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * ci: Update shared scripts and dotfiles to a9fef9a
  * build: Format meson files.
  * ci: Check meson format
  * build: Build vapi too
  * treewide: Drop glib version conditionals. We require glib 2.78 anyway
  * timeout: Conditionally cleanup source members.
    We might have partially inited sources when setting up a source fails.
    This can happen with the following changes.
  * timeout: Pass clockid. This allows us to use the code for different
    clock types
  * timeout: Add wakeup timer
  * timeout: Bubble up errors. This slightly changes the existing API/ABI as
    gm_timeout_add_seconds_once can now return 0 but given the current users
    that is likely o.k.
  * example: Add wake system example
  * build: Allow to install tests
  * packaging: Add package for tests
  * packaging: Add autopkgtest that runs the installed tests

  [ Adam ]
  * data/hwdb: Add pinephone 3.5mm headset play-pause button

gmobile (0.2.2) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * packaging: Don't set gtk_doc twice
  * doc: Link to wakeup key post.
    It has additional details to the manpage
  * data: Add display-panel for Furilabs FLX1.
    This information was built from scratch to be able to actually match the
    camera cutout and run unmodified gmobile / phosh.
  * build: Bump glib dependency.
    We want to use g_strv_builder_take()
  * util: Add helper to list all known devices.
    This makes it easier to e.g. show them in lists
  * data/hwdb: Add Google Pixel 3a (Sargo)
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/gmobile/-/issues/12
    Thanks to Giovanni Caligaris

  [ Rafael Fontenelle ]
  * Add GPL-3-or-later to README.md

  [ Sam Day ]
  * data/hwdb: Add Samsung Galaxy A5 wakeup keys

  [ Eugene Lepshy ]
  * data: Add display information for nothing,spacewar

  [ Evangelos Ribeiro Tzaras ]
  * data/hwdb: Add xioami-daisy
  * data/hwdb: Add shift6mq wakeup keys

gmobile (0.2.1) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Revert "ci: Add workaround for broken gcovr in Debian"
    This reverts commit 40a273a03c5c72b9e9790b459acf31f285291bb6.
    Debian testing has a fixed gcovr (7.2+really-1.1) again.
  * examples/run-phosh: Use scale calculation from phoc.
    Since we don't have physical dimensions for the nested display one had
    to pass in the scale to use manually. Use the data from gmobile when
    available.
  * data: Add wakeup key info for OnePlus 6/6T
  * ci: Use fdo mirror in GNOME infra. This avoids an external dependency
  * data/hwdb: Simplify entries for volume button only controllers.
    On the PP{,P} and OnePlus {Enchilada,Fajita} the volume keys are the
    only buttons on the respective controllers so we can use
    GM_WAKEUP_KEY_DEFAULT instead of listing individual keys.
  * data/hwdb: Add Juno tablets.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/gmobile/-/issues/7
    Thanks to Giovanni Caligaris
  * data/hwdb: Add generic AVRCP bluetooth hardware.
    This ensures external BT devies using this profile don't trigger unblank
    by default.
    Note that udev translates the `(AVRCP)` to `_AVRCP_`.
    Thanks to Philip Hands <phil@hands.com> for debugging this with me

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * data/hwdb: Add wakeup key info for  PinePhone Pro
  * data/hwdb: Fix PinePhone compatible string.
    The compatible string used for the original PinePhone is wrong and too
    restrictive:
    * the main string ends with the HW revision, the final `pine64` is the
      start of another compatible string
    * there are more revisions in the wild than only `1.2`, we should
      account for those as well

gmobile (0.2.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * util: Fix copyright header.
    Fixes: e8d3fa8 ("treewide: Use consistent copyright headers")
  * packaging: Update package descriptions
  * README: Mention that we can be used as a shared lib
  * build-howto: Explain how to use as a shared library
  * build: Don't use str for boolean argument. This is deprecated in meson
  * ci: No need to remove lcov anymore
  * ci: Use build dependencies. Instead of open coding these use what we have
    in packaging
  * ci: Add workaround for broken gcovr in Debian.
    See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1070172
  * ci: Add style checks
  * packaging: Handle nocheck
  * packaging: Handle nodoc
  * packaging: Ignore package dirs
  * build: Prefer '/' over join_paths()
  * data: Introduce udev rules and hwdb to track wakeup keys.
    On phones and tablets the only key that should usually unidle a device
    is the power button while other exposed hardware keys like the volume
    buttons shouldn't e.g. take the device out of idle / unblank the screen.
    Allow to specify whether an input device has wakeup keys (default is
    1) and to specify whether individual keys on that device are wakeup
    keys or not. E.g.
    gmobile:…
     GM_WAKEUP_KEY_DEFAULT=0
     GM_WAKEUP_KEY_116=1
    would mark all keys on the matching input device as non-wakeup keys
    with the exception of the power button. This would be a typical setting
    for phones. Whereas on a convertible that has a single keyboard device
    containing both the exposed volume keys as well as the regular input
    keys
    gmobile:…
     GM_WAKEUP_KEY_114=0
     GM_WAKEUP_KEY_115=0
    would allow all keys to unidle the device except for the exposed volume
    rocker.
    See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/32261 for details
    Device tree devices can't match via dmi modalias. The corresponding
    thing there is the DT compatible. Allow to match by the most specific
    part of the device tree compatible. This allows to e.g. match the volume
    keys on a Librem 5 like:
      gmobile:name:gpio-keys:dt:purism,librem5*
    matching on a specific model would look like
      gmobile:name:gpio-keys:dt:purism,librem5r4
    See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/32362 for details
  * data/hwdb: Add wakeup keys for the Librem 11 tablet
  * data/hwdb: Add wakeup keys for the Librem 5 phone
  * doc: Add manpage explaining the hwdb entries.
    This text based on parts of the libinput documentation.
