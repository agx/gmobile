  * Revert "ci: Add workaround for broken gcovr in Debian"
    This reverts commit 40a273a03c5c72b9e9790b459acf31f285291bb6.
    Debian testing has a fixed gcovr (7.2+really-1.1) again.
  * examples/run-phosh: Use scale calculation from phoc.
    Since we don't have physical dimensions for the nested display one had
    to pass in the scale to use manually. Use the data from gmobile when
    available.
  * data: Add wakeup key info for OnePlus 6/6T
  * ci: Use fdo mirror in GNOME infra. This avoids an external dependency
  * data/hwdb: Simplify entries for volume button only controllers.
    On the PP{,P} and OnePlus {Enchilada,Fajita} the volume keys are the
    only buttons on the respective controllers so we can use
    GM_WAKEUP_KEY_DEFAULT instead of listing individual keys.
  * data/hwdb: Add Juno tablets.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/gmobile/-/issues/7
    Thanks to Giovanni Caligaris
  * data/hwdb: Add generic AVRCP bluetooth hardware.
    This ensures external BT devies using this profile don't trigger unblank
    by default.
    Note that udev translates the `(AVRCP)` to `_AVRCP_`.
    Thanks to Philip Hands <phil@hands.com> for debugging this with me

  * data/hwdb: Add wakeup key info for  PinePhone Pro
  * data/hwdb: Fix PinePhone compatible string.
    The compatible string used for the original PinePhone is wrong and too
    restrictive:
    * the main string ends with the HW revision, the final `pine64` is the
      start of another compatible string
    * there are more revisions in the wild than only `1.2`, we should
      account for those as well

  * util: Fix copyright header.
    Fixes: e8d3fa8 ("treewide: Use consistent copyright headers")
  * packaging: Update package descriptions
  * README: Mention that we can be used as a shared lib
  * build-howto: Explain how to use as a shared library

  * build: Prefer '/' over join_paths()
  * data: Introduce udev rules and hwdb to track wakeup keys.
    On phones and tablets the only key that should usually unidle a device
    is the power button while other exposed hardware keys like the volume
    buttons shouldn't e.g. take the device out of idle / unblank the screen.
    Allow to specify whether an input device has wakeup keys (default is
    1) and to specify whether individual keys on that device are wakeup
    keys or not. E.g.
    gmobile:…
     GM_WAKEUP_KEY_DEFAULT=0
     GM_WAKEUP_KEY_116=1
    would mark all keys on the matching input device as non-wakeup keys
    with the exception of the power button. This would be a typical setting
    for phones. Whereas on a convertible that has a single keyboard device
    containing both the exposed volume keys as well as the regular input
    keys
    gmobile:…
     GM_WAKEUP_KEY_114=0
     GM_WAKEUP_KEY_115=0
    would allow all keys to unidle the device except for the exposed volume
    rocker.
    See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/32261 for details
    Device tree devices can't match via dmi modalias. The corresponding
    thing there is the DT compatible. Allow to match by the most specific
    part of the device tree compatible. This allows to e.g. match the volume
    keys on a Librem 5 like:
      gmobile:name:gpio-keys:dt:purism,librem5*
    matching on a specific model would look like
      gmobile:name:gpio-keys:dt:purism,librem5r4
    See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/32362 for details
  * data/hwdb: Add wakeup keys for the Librem 11 tablet
  * data/hwdb: Add wakeup keys for the Librem 5 phone
  * doc: Add manpage explaining the hwdb entries.
    This text based on parts of the libinput documentation.
